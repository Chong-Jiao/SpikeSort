The documentation was created using Sphinx. You may create a HTML
version of the documentation using:

make html

Alternatively, you can call your sphinx-build tool manually running the
following command from docs directory:

sphinx-build-2.6 -b html -d build/doctrees source build/html

Note: In order to compile figures in tutorials you need to download
tutorial.h5 file and copy it to spike_sort/data directory. In
addition, matplotlib has to be installed at the time of compilation
(it is also a dependency of spike_sort).
